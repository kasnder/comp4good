        title: "Are Companies Taking AI Risks Seriously? A Systematic Analysis of Companies' AI Risk Disclosures in SEC 10-K forms",
        authors: ["Lucas G. Uberti-Bona Marin", "Bram Rijsbosch", "Gerasimos Spanakis", "Konrad Kollnig"],
        venue: "ECML PKDD SoGood (Data Science for Social Good) Workshop",
        year: 2025,
        month: "August",
        type: "conference",
        abstract: "This study presents the first large-scale systematic analysis of AI risk disclosures in SEC 10-K filings. We analyse over 30,000 filings from more than 7,000 companies over the past five years. Our findings reveal a sharp increase in companies mentioning AI risk, up from 4% in 2020 to over 43% in 2024. While legal and competitive AI risks are most frequently mentioned, many disclosures remain generic or lack details on mitigation strategies.",

        title: "Adoption of Watermarking for Generative AI Systems in Practice and Implications under the new EU AI Act",
        authors: ["Bram Rijsbosch", "Gijs van Dijck", "Konrad Kollnig"],
        venue: "arXiv preprint",
        year: 2025,
        month: "March",
        type: "preprint",
        abstract: "Watermarking has emerged as a primary mechanism to address the risks posed by AI-generated content and is now becoming a legal requirement under the EU AI Act. This paper provides both an empirical and legal analysis of watermarking measures. We find that only a minority of AI image generators currently implement adequate watermarking (38%) and deep fake labelling (18%) practices.",

        abstract: "This paper analyzes the data access provisions of the EU's Digital Services Act (DSA) and presents the results of 27 data access requests across EU member states. The findings indicate delays and challenges in obtaining meaningful data for research, emphasizing the need for timely access to address systemic risks on online platforms.",

        authors: ["Yongle Chao", "Meihe Xu", "Aurelia Tamò-Larrieux", "Konrad Kollnig"],
        venue: "Computer Law & Security Review",
        year: 2025,
        month: "April",
        type: "journal",
        abstract: "Data portability has traditionally been considered an individual right to enhance data subjects' control over their personal data under the GDPR. This paper argues that the concept of data portability has evolved beyond its original scope of protecting individual rights, toward better access and flow for multiple stakeholders. We analyze the evolution of data portability as an important novel policy instrument in EU legislation, and contend that data interoperability is both a technical issue and a political concern.",
